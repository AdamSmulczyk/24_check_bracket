This  validation program to improve its handling of mismatched brackets.
*  1.I used an algorithm based on the stack structure to solve the task. 
*  2.I created a dictionary, called: brackets = {'}': '{', ']': '[', ')': '('},  with the appropriate key-value pairs.
*  3.First of all, I added a simple function to check the consistency of the number of opening and closing brackets.
*  4.In main function I had to use multiple conditions  for handling specific opening brackets ('{', '[', '(').
*  5. I had to keep the logic for matching closing brackets and marking unmatched ones (e.g., ']' with no preceding '[') as errors. The unmatched variable tracks whether a matching opening bracket was found.
*  6.At the end I added condition to add the redundant, opening brackets remaining on the stack to errors.
*  7.I verified results against multiple cases, including: "{[()([]}", ")){[()([]}", "{([)]}", "(][()]}()((", "({([()](}[()]()(", ensuring all mismatched brackets are identified correctly.
